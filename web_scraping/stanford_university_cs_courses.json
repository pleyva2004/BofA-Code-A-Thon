You'll learn about applying AI to real-world social good spaces (such as climate, education, and housing) and learn what this looks like in practice. The class provides a high-level overview of the machine learning and deep learning techniques that have already proven effective in tackling social problems. Overall, we aim to center the \"social good\" component of AI for Social Good and cover material you would not otherwise see in the AI curriculum at Stanford. The course structure alternates between instructional lectures and bi-weekly guest speakers at the forefront of technology for social good. Students will be given the chance to engage in a flexible combination of AI model building, discussion, and individual exploration. Special topics may include: tech ethics, human-centered AI, AI safety, education technology, mental health applications, AI in policy, assistive robotics. Prerequisites: programming experience at the level of CS106A and an interest in social impact! Application required for enrollment: \nhttp://tinyurl.com/cs21si2425. We encourage students from all disciplines and backgrounds to apply!"

            "description": "Recent advances in Generative Artificial Intelligence place us at the threshold of a unique turning point in human history. For the first time, we face the prospect that we are not the only generally intelligent entities, and indeed that we may be less capable than our own creations. As this remarkable new technology continues to advance, we are likely to entrust management of our environment, economy, security, infrastructure, food production, healthcare, and to a large degree even our personal activities, to artificially intelligent computer systems. The prospect of \"turning over the keys\" to increasingly autonomous and unpredictable machines raises many complex and troubling questions. How will society respond as they displace an ever-expanding spectrum of blue- and white-collar workers? Will the benefits of this technological revolution be broadly distributed or accrue to a lucky few? How can we ensure that these systems are free of bias and align with human ethical principles?

            "description": "(Formerly \nSYMSYS 100). An overview of the interdisciplinary study of cognition, information, communication, and language, with an emphasis on foundational issues: What are minds? What is computation? What are rationality and intelligence? Can we predict human behavior? Can computers be truly intelligent? How do people and technology interact, and how might they do so in the future? Lectures focus on how the methods of philosophy, mathematics, empirical research, and computational modeling are used to study minds and machines. Students must take this course before being approved to declare Symbolic Systems as a major. All students interested in studying Symbolic Systems are urged to take this course early in their student careers. The course material and presentation will be at an introductory level, without prerequisites. Note that this is a hybrid course. Students should plan to enroll by the first day of the quarter and check their Stanford email account for instructions on how to access the course material. If you have any questions about the course, please email symsys1staff@gmail.com."

            "description": "Since their introduction in 2017, Transformers have revolutionized Deep Learning, powering large language models (LLM) like ChatGPT and DeepSeek, image and video generation (e.g. Dall-E and Sora), and much more. In \nCS25, one of Stanford's hottest seminar courses, we delve into Transformer architectures and their diverse applications through classroom discussions and instructor and guest lectures. Topics include LLM, creative uses in art and music, healthcare, neuroscience, robotics, and so forth. We host leading researchers, with past speakers like Andrej Karpathy, Geoffrey Hinton, Jim Fan, Ashish Vaswani, and folks from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, NVIDIA, etc. Lectures are livestreamed and recorded, attracting a global audience with over a million total YouTube views. This is a 1-unit S/NC course, where attendance is the only homework! Enroll via Axess or audit through livestreams or in-person, space permitting. Prerequisites: basic Deep Learning and Transformers knowledge (understanding of attention) or completion of \nCS224N, \nCS231N, or \nCS230. Course website: \nhttps://web.stanford.edu/class/cs25/"
