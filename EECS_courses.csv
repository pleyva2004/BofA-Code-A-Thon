"""False""","Computer Science 36 is a seminar for CS Scholars who are concurrently taking CS61A: The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs. CS Scholars is a cohort-model program to provide support in exploring and potentially declaring a CS major for students with little to no computational background prior to coming to the university. CS 36 provides an introduction to the CS curriculum at UC Berkeley, and the overall CS landscape in both industry and academiaâthrough the lens of accessibility and its relevance to diversity. Additionally, CS36 provides technical instruction to review concepts in CS61A, in order to support CS Scholarsâ individual learning and success in the CS61A course."
